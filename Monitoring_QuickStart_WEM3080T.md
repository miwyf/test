## 1. Introduction
By installing only one WEM3080T (three phase WiFi energy meter) in your single phase solar system, and clamping the first CT onto grid, the second CT onto solar inverter side and the third CT onto load if applicable, you can monitor "From Grid" (the energy consumed from the grid), "To Grid" (the energy imported to the grid) and the energy produced by solar inverter. You can monitor the energy flow of the solar system.

## 2. Wiring Diagram

Install the meter on grid side and ensure that the CT direction is correct.

Please refer to [Tutorial Video](https://youtu.be/xoj6jcxxA-E) for hardware installation guidance.

## 4. Wi-Fi Setup by Mobile App
Step1, scan the QR code and download the mobile app

![Step1](https://leweidoc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/lewei50/img/iammeter-32-20190809-L1.jpg)

Step 2, search and connect the iMeter's access point signal iMeter_xxxxxxxx by your phone

![Step 2](https://leweidoc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/lewei50/img/iammeter-32-20190809-L2.jpg)

Step 3, Open app and find the iMeter

![Step 3](https://leweidoc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/lewei50/img/iammeter-32-20190809-L3.jpg)

> Tips: If the app prompts "Invalid device version", you need to setup the WiFi network by browser. Same as [3.3 WEM3162T QuickStart](https://www.iammeter.com/doc/iammeter/wem3162t-quickstart.html)


Step 4, Select the SSID of your home WiFi network;

![Step 4](https://leweidoc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/lewei50/img/iammeter-32-20190809-L4.jpg)

Step 5, Enter password and save. After succesfully configure the WiFi settings, you will see that the IP address allocated for the iMeter.

> Tips: SN is the unique Serial Number of your iMeter. You can copy it from the iMeter's access point signal (iMeter_xxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxx is the SN). 

## 5. Set the Time Zone

![Time Zone](https://leweidoc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/lewei50/img/iammeter-31-20190809-L7.jpg)

> Tips: Time zone must be set according to your location for correct data display and report on time basis. 

## 6. Edit the Meter Type

![Edit the Meter](https://leweidoc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/lewei50/img/iammeter-33-20190809-L5.jpg)

> Tips: It is "Single phase" as default meter type in Iammeter system. You need to change the meter "Type" as "Three phase"

## 7. Set the Use Type of Each CT
