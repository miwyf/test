## 1. Introduction
As a bi-directional Wi-Fi energy meter, our WiFi Energy Meter is very ideal for use in a solar system. By bi-directional function, it is able to measure the energy "to grid" or "from grid" by only one meter. The meter can upload the measurement (Voltage, Current, Active Power, Active Energy, Frequency...) to the cloud. So you can easily to monitor the below KPI of a solar system online:
- energy generated by solar inverter
- to-grid energy (energy exported to grid)
- from-grid energy (energy imported from grid)
- direct self-use energy

You have two options to realize that:
1. You can install **two single phase iMeters** in a solar system;
2. You can install **one three phase iMeter** in a solar system


## 2. Install two single phase iMeters in a solar system

As shown in below picture, in a single phase solar system, the single phase iMeter can be installed in two locations accroding to your actual requirement and condition:
