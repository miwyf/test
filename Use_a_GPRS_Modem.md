We have GPRS modem (Model: Elfin-EG11), which is used with our WiFi Energy Meter together for the users to install the WiFi Energy Meter to where there is no WiFi network coverage. The users can use GPRS modem to read and tranfer the meter's data to our cloud via GSM/GPRS network. We already set the configuration, so you will not need to do any configuration. Just insert the SIM card, power on it and then it will work.
