## FAQ

**1. Tell me about the WiFi energy meter.**

The WiFi energy meter can measure and record energy parameters such as Voltage, Current, Active power and Energy, and report these values to our cloud every minute. The meters are widely used in both residential electricity system and solar PV system.

**2. How can I see the demo of Iammeter system and app?**

To see the demo of the web portal of our energy monitoring cloud (Iammeter Portal), please visit [Demo of Web Portal](https://www.iammeter.com/home/autologin/faq_pc) by your PC;

**7. How to apply the meter in a solar system**

Please refer to [Apply the meter in a solar system](https://www.iammeter.com/doc/iammeter/monitor-your-solar-system.html) for details.

**8. Can I use this meter in a place without internet**

Yes, you can monitor the data locally via WLAN, no internet needed. Please refer to [Local Monitoring](https://www.iammeter.com/doc/iammeter/local-monitoring.html) for details.

**9. We don't want to use Iammeter cloud. Can I integrate the meter's reading to our own server?**

Yes, the meter can transfer the data to your server by setting TCP or SSL parameters. In this way, you don't need to register on Iammeter and the meter's data will not store on Iammeter cloud. Please refer to [Intergrated with Third Party Server](https://www.iammeter.com/doc/iammeter/integrate-with-thirdparty-server.html) for details.

**10. What is the maximum CT ratings? How can I measure the current larger than that?**

The maximum CT rating is 250A. If you want to measure the current larger than 250A, instead of using a large rating of CT with very large ratio, we recommend the more cost-effective solution with same measurement accuracy, double CT solution, which is also called Secondary Mutual Inductance. Please refer to [Double CT Solution](https://www.iammeter.com/doc/iammeter/double-ct.html) for details.
