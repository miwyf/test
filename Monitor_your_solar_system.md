If you have a solar system, you can use our bi-dirctional WiFi energy meter to monitor the power and energy flow of your solar system.

There are two way to monitor your solar system.

- Monitor two-way energy flow (consumed "from grid" and export "to grid") by using one single phase WiFi energy meter (WEM3080);
- Monitor the all energy flow ("from grid", "to grid" and the energy/power produced by solar inverter) 

You can also set the power tariff for both the energy consumed from grid and exported to grid in the system,and then generate the report to view your electricity bill and income of your solar system on daily or monthly basis.

## 2. Monitor your solar system

### 2.1 Monitor "From Grid" and "To Grid" energy by one single phase WiFi energy meter (WEM3080)

[1.  Purchase WEM3080 on Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/10000027347908.html)
 [2. QuickStart for monitoring your solar system by WEM3080](https://www.iammeter.com/doc/iammeter/monitoring-quickstart-wem3080.html)

By installing only one WEM3080 in your single phase solar system, you can monitor two-way power and energy flow, the energy consumed from grid and exported to grid simultaneously.

### 2.2 Monitor the all energy flow by one three phase WiFi energy meter (WEM3080T)

 [2. QuickStart for monitoring your solar system by WEM3080T](https://www.iammeter.com/doc/iammeter/monitoring-quickstart-wem3080t.html)


By installing only one WEM3080T in your single phase solar system, and clamping the first CT onto grid, the second CT onto solar inverter side and the third CT onto load if applicable (you can also leave the third CT unclamped if not needed), you can monitor "From Grid" (the energy consumed from the grid), "To Grid" (the energy imported to the grid) and the energy produced by solar inverter.  You will also see the direct self-use energy and the energy consumed by your load.

## 3. Billing and income report
### 3.1 Set the power tariff

You can set the power tariff for both the energy consumed from grid (Power Tariff) and the energy exported to grid (Feed in Tariff).
